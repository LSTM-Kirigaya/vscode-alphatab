This is a vscode extension impl of the [AlphaTab](https://alphatab.net/). With alpha tex, a format for guitar tab, you can write and render your guitar tab just in vscode.

## Quick Start 🪽

open vscode, create `<name>.alphatab` and write alphatex, click `open preview` in top right corner of your editor and review the score in webview.

You can switch render mode (term as stave profile) through first yellow switch block ╰(*°▽°*)╯.

You can even play tab with build-in guitar soundfile! I provide three guitar sounds: 8 bit LOFI guitar, Acoustic Guitar and Electric Guitar. You can use the function to have a quick view over the melody 🎸.

## Write and Render

Once open the preview, you can write the alphatex, and webview will receive the change debouncively and rerender the score.

If you aren't familiar with alphatex, [here](https://alphatab.net/docs/alphatex/introduction/) is the tutorial.
